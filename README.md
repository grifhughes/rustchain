# rustchain
Basic command line wrapper written in Rust for the blockchain wallet api, requires UNIX/nightly compiler

Must have blockchain wallet serivice installed, see: https://github.com/blockchain/service-my-wallet-v3#installation

TODO
- command line args vs. user input
- decode JSON responses
- handle multiple wallet files
- implement remaining api functionality
- some semblance of decent error checking
